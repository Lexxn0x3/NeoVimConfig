# 🚀 My Personal Neovim Configuration 🌌

Hey there! Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration repo. This setup is my daily driver for coding, note-taking, and everything in-between. It's tailored to my workflow and preferences, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But, who knows, you might find something interesting here! 🤓

## 🎨 Theme

I'm using the **Catppuccin** theme because it's easy on the eyes and makes the coding environment more enjoyable. Plus, who doesn't love a bit of cat-themed goodness in their editor?

## 🛠 Features

This setup is all about making life easier and more productive. Here are some of the highlights:

- **Auto Pairs**: Automatically closes quotes, brackets, etc. It's like having a coding buddy who finishes your sentences.
- **Barbar**: A top-notch tab bar for Neovim. Keeps everything organized and accessible.
- **NeoTree**: A file explorer that doesn't suck. It's like the GPS for your codebase.
- **UndoTree**: Ever made a mistake and wished you could go back? UndoTree makes it possible. It's like a time machine for your code.
- ...and much more!

## ⚡️ Quick Start

If you're daring enough to try out my setup, here's how you can get started:

1. Clone this repo into your Neovim configuration folder:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2. Open Neovim and run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins.
3. Enjoy your new, souped-up Neovim setup!
